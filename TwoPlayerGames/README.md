# two-player-games
Library of two-player logical games along with the alpha-beta pruning algorithm.

## Architecture

Two primary base classes of the games are `Game` and `State`.

These two classes have very similar functionalities, with the following differences:
 - a `Game` object contains a `State` object
 - making move on a `Game` object changes its state while making move on a `State` object returns new state without affecting the previous one.
 - a `State` object may have more game-specific functionalities

Common functionalities of `Game` and `State`:
 - getting the list of avaliable moves
 - getting current player
 - checking if a game has finished

## Usage example

```python
from two_player_games.games.morris import SixMensMorris  # or any other game
import random


game = SixMensMorris()

while not game.is_finished():
    moves = game.get_moves()
    move = random.choice(moves)
    game.make_move(move)

winner = game.get_winner()
if winner is None:
    print('Draw!')
else:
    print('Winner: Player ' + winner.char)

```

## Disclaimer
This directory is based on the original [two-player-games repository](https://github.com/lychanl/two-player-games/) by lychanl. These files are used for experiments with the alpha-beta pruning algorithm. My input are the files handling the minimax-based algorithms and some minor changes in the game implementation.
